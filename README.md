Plugin for 

Hello I´m Fabio aka Sebosfato and im from Brasil... 

This is a project to develop a free plugin for woocommerce based on Ups API to allow developing countries to be able to export their products without having to pay for use plugings... 

I hope the comunity can help us get there. For this we can chat with the issues or pull requests tab... 

Im not realy familiar with plugin development so im trying to use ChatGpt to give me a hand on that! 

If you have some working code that you can share please do it! would certainly help many people! 

Thanks and welcome
