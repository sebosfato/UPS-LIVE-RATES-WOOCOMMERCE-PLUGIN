# UPS-LIVE-RATES-WOOCOMMERCE-PLUGIN
Plugin for 

Hello IÂ´m Fabio aka Sebosfato and im from Brasil... 

This is a project to develop a free plugin for woocommerce based on Ups API to allow developing countries to be able to export their products without having to pay for use plugings... 

I hope the comunity can help us get there. For this we can chat with the issues or pull requests tab... 

Im not realy familiar with plugin development so im trying to use ChatGpt to give me a hand on that! 

If you have some working code that you can share please do it! would certainly help many people! 

Thanks and welcome

At this point of development:

The plugin is able to add a shiping method in the list for woocommerce but is not yet showing up in the cart page. 

Problem seem to be it misses passing the info of the packet for geting the rate or something... 

the rate worked on the php without the plugin with the file you see as back.php
